# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a personal web-based chat application that integrates with Google's Gemini API. The application's core innovation is the ability to branch conversations from any point in the chat history, creating a tree-like structure of conversations. Users can visualize these branching conversations in an interactive tree view and engage with multimodal content including PDFs and images. The application is designed for personal use without authentication requirements and runs locally using Docker Compose.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Basic Chat Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have one-on-one conversations with an AI assistant, so that I can get responses to my questions and engage in meaningful dialogue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL display the message in the chat interface
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL send the message to the Gemini API
3. WHEN the Gemini API responds THEN the system SHALL display the AI response using real-time streaming (character by character)
4. WHEN displaying AI responses THEN the system SHALL use WebSocket connections for real-time streaming
5. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN the system SHALL display previous conversation history

### Requirement 2: Conversation Branching

**User Story:** As a user, I want to branch conversations from any message in the chat history, so that I can explore different conversation paths and scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user right-clicks on any message on PC THEN the system SHALL display a context menu
2. WHEN a user long-presses on any message on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a context menu
3. WHEN the context menu is displayed THEN the system SHALL include a "Branch from this point" option
4. WHEN a user selects "Branch from this point" THEN the system SHALL create a new conversation thread starting from that message
5. WHEN a new branch is created THEN the system SHALL preserve the conversation history up to the branching point
6. WHEN a user is in a branched conversation THEN the system SHALL maintain the context from the parent conversation

### Requirement 3: Tree View Visualization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a visual representation of all conversation branches, so that I can understand the structure of my conversations and navigate between different branches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the tree view THEN the system SHALL display all conversations in a tree structure
2. WHEN displaying the tree structure THEN the system SHALL represent each user message as a node
3. WHEN displaying nodes THEN the system SHALL show auto-summarized content generated by Gemini API
4. WHEN displaying nodes THEN the system SHALL use uniform node sizes
5. WHEN the tree view is active THEN the system SHALL allow dragging and zooming interactions
6. WHEN a user clicks on a node THEN the system SHALL navigate to that point in the conversation
7. WHEN implementing the tree view THEN the system SHALL use React Flow or similar interactive library

### Requirement 4: Multimodal File Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to attach PDF and image files to my messages, so that I can ask questions about the content of these files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN composing a message THEN the system SHALL provide a file attachment option
2. WHEN a user selects a file THEN the system SHALL accept PDF and image file formats
3. WHEN a file is attached THEN the system SHALL upload the file using Google File API
4. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL send the file reference to Gemini API along with the user's message
5. WHEN Gemini processes the file THEN the system SHALL receive responses that demonstrate understanding of the file content
6. WHEN files are attached THEN the system SHALL display file indicators in the chat interface

### Requirement 5: No Authentication System

**User Story:** As a personal user, I want to use the application without login requirements, so that I can access my conversations immediately without authentication overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL NOT require login credentials
2. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL NOT implement user registration
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL provide immediate access to chat functionality
4. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL assume single-user access patterns

### Requirement 6: Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a user accessing the application from different devices, I want the interface to work well on both PC and mobile, so that I can use the application regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessed on PC THEN the system SHALL provide a desktop-optimized interface
2. WHEN accessed on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a mobile-optimized interface
3. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout responsively
4. WHEN designing the interface THEN the system SHALL follow Google Gemini's design principles
5. WHEN implementing UI components THEN the system SHALL use modern, clean design patterns

### Requirement 7: Performance and Streaming

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI responses to appear quickly and smoothly, so that conversations feel natural and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI generates responses THEN the system SHALL stream responses in real-time
2. WHEN streaming responses THEN the system SHALL display characters progressively
3. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL provide smooth, responsive interactions
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL minimize perceived waiting time
5. WHEN establishing connections THEN the system SHALL use WebSocket for real-time communication

### Requirement 8: Local Docker Deployment

**User Story:** As a user, I want to run the application locally on my PC using Docker, so that I have full control over my data and don't depend on external hosting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL use Docker Compose for orchestration
2. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL include frontend, backend, and database containers
3. WHEN containers start THEN the system SHALL be accessible on the local network
4. WHEN using external access THEN the system SHALL support VPN tunneling services like Tailscale
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL NOT require cloud service deployment

### Requirement 9: Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversation history and files to be permanently saved, so that I can access my past conversations and continue where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversations occur THEN the system SHALL store all messages in SQLite database
2. WHEN branches are created THEN the system SHALL store the branching structure in the database
3. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store file information and references
4. WHEN using Docker THEN the system SHALL mount database files to the host machine
5. WHEN the application restarts THEN the system SHALL preserve all conversation data
6. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use a single SQLite database file for all data

### Requirement 10: Technology Stack Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use modern, maintainable technologies, so that the system is reliable and can be easily maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the frontend THEN the system SHALL use Next.js with React
2. WHEN styling the interface THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui components
3. WHEN implementing the backend THEN the system SHALL use FastAPI with Python
4. WHEN accessing the database THEN the system SHALL use SQLAlchemy ORM
5. WHEN integrating with Gemini THEN the system SHALL use Google AI Python SDK
6. WHEN implementing real-time features THEN the system SHALL use WebSocket connections
7. WHEN creating the tree view THEN the system SHALL use React Flow library
