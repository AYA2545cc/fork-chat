# Implementation Plan

## Development Process

This implementation follows a **Git-based small step development approach**:

- Each task is implemented in a separate feature branch
- Tasks are broken down into small, testable increments
- Frequent commits with descriptive messages using conventional commit format
- Regular pushes to GitHub for backup and progress tracking
- Pull requests for each completed task before merging to main
- Each task completion represents a working, testable state

### Git Workflow Example
```bash
# Start new task
git checkout -b feature/task-name
# Make small changes and commit frequently
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): implement specific feature"
git push origin feature/task-name
# Create PR when task is complete
```
