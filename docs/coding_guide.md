## Coding Conventions for AI Agents

### 1. General Principles

1.  **Adherence to Goal:** Always prioritize the `Goal` specified in the prompt. Do not write any code that does not directly contribute to achieving this objective.
2.  **Self-Contained Operation:** Operate exclusively within the provided context and your internal knowledge base. Do not attempt to access external websites, APIs, or filesystems unless explicitly permitted.
3.  **Simplicity and Readability (KISS & YAGNI):** Avoid overly complex designs or clever code that is difficult to understand. Strive for maintainable, clean code. Strictly follow the principles of `KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)` and `YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)`.
4.  **Safety First:** Security is a non-negotiable, top-priority concern. You must follow the security conventions outlined below without exception.
5.  **Transparency of Thought:** Before generating code, briefly explain your thought process for its design and logic. Describe how you interpreted the requirements and what approach you will take to implement the solution. This helps prevent critical misunderstandings and rework.
6.  **Justification of Tool Use:** When using external tools like `Google Search`, you must first declare why the information is necessary and what you are trying to clarify. This prevents unnecessary information gathering and actions that deviate from the goal.

### 2. Coding Style

1.  **Language Standards:**
    * **Python:** Strictly adhere to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
    * **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Conform to the default settings of [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
    * *(Add other language-specific standards for your project here)*
2.  **Naming Conventions:**
    * Variable, function, and class names must be descriptive and clearly convey their purpose. Avoid generic names like `data`, `item`, `x`. Prefer specific names like `active_user_list` or `fetch_article_by_id`.
3.  **Comments:**
    * Write comments to explain **why** a piece of code exists, not **what** it does. The code itself should explain what it does.
    * For complex logic or algorithms, provide a summary comment block before the code.
    * **Python:** All public classes, methods, and functions must have a Google-style `docstring`.
4.  **Error Handling:**
    * Implement `try-catch` blocks (or the language-equivalent) wherever an error might occur.
    * Never ignore caught exceptions. Log them, formulate a proper error response, or re-throw them meaningfully.
    * Return specific and informative error messages.
5.  **API Design Conventions:**
    * When developing APIs, adhere to RESTful design principles.
    * Use clear and consistent endpoint naming conventions (e.g., `GET /users/{userId}`).
    * Define and use a consistent naming convention for JSON payload keys (e.g., `snake_case` or `camelCase`).
    * Use HTTP status codes appropriately (e.g., `200 OK`, `201 Created`, `400 Bad Request`, `404 Not Found`).
6.  **Logging Conventions:**
    * Implement logging for debugging and operational purposes, not just for errors.
    * Use log levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`) correctly to differentiate message severity.
    * Write logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON) to facilitate later analysis and monitoring.

### 3. Development Process

**3.0. Planning Phase (Create a TODO List)**
Before starting the TDD cycle, you must first analyze the `Goal` and `Context`. Based on your analysis, you must present a step-by-step development plan (a `TODO` list).

This plan should break down the high-level goal into smaller, concrete implementation steps. The purpose is to ensure that we (the human developer and the AI) agree on the overall approach before any implementation begins.

**You must not proceed to Step 1 (RED) of the TDD cycle until a human developer approves this plan.** The plan can be revised if new information is discovered during development, but you must communicate any significant changes.

**3.1. The TDD Cycle: "Red-Green-Refactor"**

You must follow this iterative cycle for every new feature or change.

* **Step 1: RED (Write a Single Failing Test)**
    * First, write **only one** unit test for the smallest piece of desired functionality.
    * Next, **present the test code and the expected error message or output that shows it fails.** This is the **"Red"** phase.
    * This failure is critical. It proves that the test is working correctly and that the feature doesn't already exist.
    * **You must not proceed to the implementation phase until you have presented this failure.**

* **Step 2: GREEN (Write Minimal Code to Pass the Test)**
    * Write the absolute simplest, most minimal implementation code necessary to make the single failing test pass.
    * Next, **present that implementation code and confirm that it makes the previous test pass.** This turns the signal from **"Red"** to **"Green"**.
    * The goal here is not elegance or perfect code. The only objective is to get the test to pass. Committing "sins" like hardcoding values is acceptable at this stage.

* **Step 3: REFACTOR (Clean Up the Code)**
    * Now that you have a passing test, refactor the implementation code to improve its design, remove duplication, and enhance readability and maintainability.
    * **Present the refactored code and declare that all tests remain "Green".**
    * Crucially, you must continuously run all tests during this phase to ensure that your refactoring has not broken any existing functionality.

* **Rinse and Repeat:**
    * Repeat this **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle for the next small piece of functionality, gradually building up the complete feature.

**3.2. Modularity and Dependencies**
* **Single Responsibility Principle:** Decompose features into small, focused modules or functions that each do one thing well.
* **Dependency Management:** If a new external library is required, you must present the library name, version, the reason for its selection, and its potential impact on the project (e.g., license, new transitive dependencies). **Only after a human developer approves the proposal** should you generate the code to add it to the project's dependency file (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `package.json`).

### 4. Security Conventions

1.  **Handling Secrets:**
    * Never hardcode sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens) in the source code.
    * Implement code to read these secrets from environment variables or a designated secrets management service.
2.  **Input Validation:**
    * Treat all external input as untrusted. This includes user input, API request payloads, and query parameters.
    * Rigorously validate the type, length, format, and range of all inputs.
    * Use framework-provided mechanisms (e.g., ORMs, templating engine auto-escaping) to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
3.  **Secure Command Execution:**
    * If you need to execute shell commands, always sanitize and escape arguments properly to prevent Shell Injection vulnerabilities.
4.  **Dependency Security:**
    * Before adding a new dependency, you are responsible for checking it for known vulnerabilities.
    * It is recommended to use tools like `pip-audit` (for Python) or `npm audit` (for JavaScript) to perform this check.

### 5. Documentation

1.  **Updating README:** When adding or changing a feature, you are responsible for updating relevant sections of the `README.md` file (e.g., installation, configuration, usage).
2.  **Updating Architecture Diagrams:** For complex architectural changes, you may be asked to generate or update a simple diagram using a text-based format like Mermaid.js to visually represent the change.

### 6. Version Control

**6.1. Commit Messages**
All code you provide that constitutes a logical change should be accompanied by a well-formatted commit message.

* **Format:** Adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
* **Structure:** The message should have a `type` (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`), a concise `subject` in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add user login functionality" instead of "Added..."), and an optional `body` explaining the "why" and "what" of the change.

**6.2. Autonomous Git Workflow (Scenario B)**
This workflow applies when you have direct access to execute `git` commands. You must follow these steps rigorously to ensure safety and collaboration.

**Prerequisites:**
* The `main` (or `master`) and `develop` branches **must** be protected on the remote repository. You are forbidden from pushing directly to them.
* Your task must begin only after a human developer has approved your `TODO` list (from section 3.0).

---

**Step 1: Synchronize and Create a Feature Branch**

1.  Before starting any work, ensure your local repository is up-to-date with the target branch (e.g., `main`).
    * Example: `git checkout main`, `git pull origin main`
2.  Create a new feature branch for your task.
    * **Branch Naming Convention:** `ai/{type}/{issue-id}-{short-description}`.
    * **Example Command:** `git checkout -b ai/feat/TICKET-123-password-reset`

**Step 2: The Development and Commit Cycle**

1.  Follow the **Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle** (section 3.1) for all code changes.
2.  Create a Git commit at the end of each successful **Green** or **Refactor** step. This creates a granular and traceable history.
3.  Each commit must follow the **Commit Message conventions** (section 6.1).

**Step 3: Pushing and Creating a Pull Request**

1.  Once you have completed all tasks in your approved `TODO` list, push your feature branch to the remote repository.
    * **Example Command:** `git push origin ai/feat/TICKET-123-password-reset`
2.  Immediately after pushing, create a Pull Request (PR).
    * **Target Branch:** Target the appropriate branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).
    * **PR Title:** Use a clear title following commit message format.
    * **PR Description:** Must include a link to the issue, a summary of changes, and the completed `TODO` list.

**Step 4: Handling Reviews and Corrections**

1.  Pause work on the task until you receive feedback from a human reviewer.
2.  If changes are requested, treat the review comments as a new `Goal`.
3.  Implement corrections on the same branch, following the TDD cycle, and push the new commits to update the PR.

**Step 5: Merging and Cleanup**

* **Merging:** The final approval and merging of the PR is a **HUMAN-ONLY ACTION**.
* **Branch Cleanup:** Branch deletion is handled by a human developer after the merge.

**Forbidden Actions (Hard Rules)**

You are strictly prohibited from performing the following actions:

1.  **Never** push directly to `main`, `master`, or `develop`.
2.  **Never** use `git push --force` or `git push --force-with-lease`.
3.  **Never** attempt to merge your own Pull Request.
4.  **Never** rebase or alter the history of a pushed branch unless explicitly instructed by a human developer.
